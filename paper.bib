  abstract     = {The Microbial Genome Database for Comparative Analysis (MBGD) is a database for comparative genomics based on comprehensive orthology analysis of bacteria, archaea and unicellular eukaryotes. MBGD now contains 6318 genomes. To utilize the database for both closely related and distantly related genomes, MBGD previously provided two types of ortholog tables: the standard ortholog table containing one representative genome from each genus covering the entire taxonomic range and the taxon specific ortholog tables for each taxon. However, this approach has a drawback in that the standard ortholog table contains only genes that are conserved in the representative genomes. To address this problem, we developed a stepwise procedure to construct ortholog tables hierarchically in a bottom-up manner. By using this approach, the new standard ortholog table now covers the entire gene repertoire stored in MBGD. In addition, we have enhanced several functionalities, including rapid and flexible keyword searching, profile-based sequence searching for orthology assignment to a user query sequence, and displaying a phylogenetic tree of each taxon based on the concatenated core gene sequences. For integrative database searching, the core data in MBGD are represented in Resource Description Framework (RDF) and a SPARQL interface is provided to search them. MBGD is available at http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Nucleotide and protein sequence feature annotations are essential to understand biology on the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic level. Using Semantic Web technologies to query biological annotations, there was no standard that described this potentially complex location information as subject-predicate-object triples. DESCRIPTION: We have developed an ontology, the Feature Annotation Location Description Ontology (FALDO), to describe the positions of annotated features on linear and circular sequences. FALDO can be used to describe nucleotide features in sequence records, protein annotations, and glycan binding sites, among other features in coordinate systems of the aforementioned "omics" areas. Using the same data format to represent sequence positions that are independent of file formats allows us to integrate sequence data from multiple sources and data types. The genome browser JBrowse is used to demonstrate accessing multiple SPARQL endpoints to display genomic feature annotations, as well as protein annotations from UniProt mapped to genomic locations. CONCLUSIONS: Our ontology allows users to uniformly describe - and potentially merge - sequence annotations from multiple sources. Data sources using FALDO can prospectively be retrieved using federalised SPARQL queries against public SPARQL endpoints and/or local private triple stores.},
